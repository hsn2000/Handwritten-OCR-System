This repository only consists of overview of the project. The actual code and implementation are confidential.

• Designed and implemented a deep learning-based Handwritten OCR system to convert handwritten text into machine-readable format using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and sequence modeling.

• Trained the model from scratch, employing neural networks and data augmentation techniques to handle diverse handwriting styles and improve accuracy.

• Envisioned the integration of the system into automated assignment grading platforms to address challenges in evaluating handwritten student submissions.

• Focused on leveraging AI and deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in education technology.
